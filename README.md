# Byte Discord.js Boilerplate

The boilerplate as of right now is relatively basic but it's all you need to be able to start on a discord.js bot project. I am mainly using it as a jumping off point for jobs where I need to make a bot in discord.js

## Installation

1. Pull the repository and then install the packages.

```
yarn install
```

or if you would prefer to use npm you can do that.

```
npm install
```

2. Add your bot's token to the .env file.

```
BOT_TOKEN=whateveryourtokenis
```

3. Uncomment the .env line in the .gitignore.

```
# Uncomment the following line once you add your token to the .env
.env
```
